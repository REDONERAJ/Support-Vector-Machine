# Support-Vector-Machine
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised ML algorithm for classification and regression. It works by finding an optimal hyperplane that best separates classes with maximum margin. Using kernels, SVM handles linear and nonlinear data, offering high accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces.
